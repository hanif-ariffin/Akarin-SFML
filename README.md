# Stardust

A simple 'game' where you move around and there will be trails of you behind.

This program is made possible by utilizing the follow libraries:

	1. SFML OpenGL

	2. OpenAL32



## LINUX MACHINE INSTALLATION

The compilation in Linux is done via GCC. GCC is usually already provided so just execute:

	chmod +x run.sh

	./run.sh

## WIN32 MACHINE INSTALLATION

The compilation in Win32 is done via Microsoft C Compiler (CL). You need to have Microsoft Visual Studio installed. I have not yet created a batch script that will compile this from the CLI so you will have to compile this from MVS :3

Oh and in both cases you will need to install SFML!
